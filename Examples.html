                <p>The Web Development Bootcamp from Udemy has taught me a lot of things regarding <strong>Full Stack Web Development.</strong> I have learned basic and advanced HTML, CSS, and Javascript. As well as jQuery, bootstrap, the various libraries and CDN's about static and dynamic webpages. On the back-end of Web Development I have learned about the Command Line, Node JS, Express, MongoDB, and Semantic UI. Using tools like Visual Studio and Goorm, I have been able to create <strong>full stack websites</strong> and I am ready to utlize these skills full-time!</p>

                <h1 class="IntroFont">Power BI Dashboarding</h1>
                <p>I first started using Power BI at my time at Pratt & Whitney Component Solutions. There was actually a week long training session that was held on the site, hosted by Blue Granite. Our instructor taught us the basics about relationship and data modeling, creating visualizations, and the use of DAX. From there, I was tasked with becomming the Power BI SME - subject matter expert, and created all dashboards for management.</p>
                <p>I further utilized my Power BI skills at Dematic. I created a Customer Database with historical as well as live data on customer sales, the types of projects that were being supported, customer data, and cost, margin, and sale data. I was able to take a multi-echelon approach in the visualizations and modeling to present a lot of data to salesmen and estimators that would have otherwise taken multiple screens to achieve.</p>

                <h1 class="IntroFont">Access, SQL, and Excel</h1>
                <p>I have utilized Microsoft Access and Excel at both Pratt & Whitney and Dematic. Microsoft Access was where customer data, and orders from our online ordering platform was housed at Pratt & Whitney. I often utilized the data inside for reporting, checking for errors in transactions, and finding answers for account rep questions. I utilize Excel daily at my job at Dematic. I am often tasked to create reports for managers and employees that can be refreshed. Data is pulled from Salesforce, SAP, or SQL Server and is manipulated in Power Query and measurements are calculated in the data model to achieve the desired result.</p>
                <p>Because I am often using Access and Excel, I am also using SQL and DAX. Having a working knowledge of these lanugages allows me to get results more quickly. Every report I create, I learn more about these languages and will continue to refine my skills in any way necessary to obtain the required conclusion.</p>

                <h1 class="IntroFont">Change Management and Training</h1>
                <p>There have been many times I have been tasked with leading a training session or creating a change management plan for new implementations. At Pratt & Whitney, there were multiple iterations of a fix or solution, and the employees had to adjust their work accordingly. I developed the change management schedule, answered the questions of the employees, and held multiple training sessions to ease the transition for all involved.</p>
                <p>At Dematic, I also had to train users how to use the technology that was presented to them. This could be as simple as refreshing their report and changing filters, or how to manipulate a dashboard using slicers, or viewing tooltips. I have also began to train my co-workers in how to model data and create a working dashboard.</p>

                <h1 class="IntroFont">Project Management</h1>
                <p>I also have a Project Management background as well. At Pratt & Whitney, I was tasked with organizing the method of cleaning customer data. Over 25,000 customers needed to be vetted to determine if they were active, if their details were correct, if there were duplicates of the account, and if they were purchasing via our online platform. I worked with account reps and management to detemermine the best course of action, and held weekly updates with the data team to ensure that changes were completed in a timely manner.</p>
                <p>Further, at Dematic, I had a similar task. I often worked with co-workers to determine the right course of action to clean up the customer data, as well as create a process to prevent this cleanup from being needed in the future.</p>

                <h1 class="IntroFont">Testing and Requirement Analysis</h1>
                <p>Part of any job is the analyis and targeting of errors. As I create new reports, I will always test the data and ensure that it is accurate before the report is distributed to the end user. Validating data and the processes used are extremely important in developing the trust of coworkers and customers. Also familiarizing myself with these strategies made testing and improving methodologies easier and more efficient. </p>
                <p>Testing is also an integral part of the success of new implementations. Testing to see if there are any errors in current processes, reproducing any errors to determine the cause and solution, and testing the fix to ensure that it will be successful in a variety of situations, are all things that I have become well-versed in. I was the main tester for Pratt & Whitney Component Solutions for the online ordering platform. Because of the various updates, I was testing quite frequently and have become very familiar with determining test case scenarios and potential solutions, performing tests, and reporting outputs to developers.</p>
